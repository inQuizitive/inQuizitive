# inQuizitive
###### inQuizitive is a quiz application, handcrafed by [Evan](https://github.com/evanmorrisdev), [Lisa](https://github.com/lisarawlings), [Le-Ann](https://github.com/LRWright) and [Ruaraidh](https://github.com/ruarplum) as part of a student project at Code Nation's Master: Coding 12-week bootcamp!

###### We built this app over 9 days using the MERN stack. This is a combination of MongoDB, Express, JS, React JS and Node JS.We also used Axios to connect the server and client together through Express JS.

###### This app allows you to create a user, log in, log out and delete your account. You can then take the quiz, choosing multiple choice or true/false questions and selecting the difficulty level of the quiz.

###### There is also the functionality to check the leaderboard for all players, to see who got the highest result. You can filter the leaderboard for specific categories, types of quiz and difficulty. We have build a user history page to display all quizzes taken and results, this component also contains the functionality to filter the results.

###### The technologies we have used to build this app is the MERN stack. This is an open-source stack, which is abbreviated to MongoDB, Express, React.js and Node.js.
